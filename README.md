# A convex optimization approach to compute Rt

A direct method to compute $R_t$, the effective reproduction number. This contains the exact solution to the linear problem. 
The programs offer a comparison with Cori et al. using a synthetic sequence created with a SERI model.

Download the synthetic sequence generator code from
https://github.com/cobeylab/Rt_estimation/tree/master/code

and modify the directories in RtLinearFormSimpleBenchmark.Rmd to point to the data and the code.
